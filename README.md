The `Greebler` package contains utilities to assist in working with greebles, also called nurnies. One of the primary design goals of the project is to avoid using any pre-generated images, so all the greebles are created procedurally using drawing operations as needed.

## Playgrounds

In the [Playgrounds folder](https://github.com/btfranklin/Greebler/tree/main/Playgrounds), you will find examples of how to use many of the package's greeble generators.
